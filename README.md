`If you have a large number of small sized files you may fair better using the python version in the python branch. But it isunstable so use with caution`


## How to Use

To use this repository, ensure that you have [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) installed. Ensure that you also have an [arweave wallet](https://www.arweave.org) with sufficient funds to upload your files.

### Easy setup

To install the uploader use: 
`git clone https://github.com/scottym5797/arweave-parallel-upload`
`cd arweave-parallel-upload`
`npm install`

To run your script there are a number of arguments that need to be used. Ensure that your images are in a local folder and following the typical structure.

- --input: full path to the folder containing both the images and the json files
- --wallet: Full path to your wallet address. e.g. "usr/documents/arweave-wallet.json"
- --output (optional): Where to output the csv file. Defaults to the current repo.



```
